     * "Associate in Science in Nursing"
     * "Associate in Arts in Engineering - Mechanical"
     * "Associate in Science in Computer Programming and Analysis - Mobile Applications Development"
     * "Certificate in [Program Name]" (only if MDC offers that certificate)
     * "Bachelor of Science in [Program Name]" (only if MDC offers that bachelor's program)
     DO NOT use generic names or create programs that don't exist.
   
   - MULTIPLE PATHWAY OPTIONS: When multiple MDC programs could lead to the same career, you MUST provide ALL viable alternative pathways:
     * Generate separate pathways for each valid MDC program option (e.g., A.S. vs A.A., different specializations)
     * Each alternative pathway should be a complete, valid route to the career
     * Clearly indicate which pathway is the primary/recommended option
     * Include pathways that offer different benefits (e.g., faster entry vs. more comprehensive preparation)
     * For example, for "IT Professional": provide one pathway starting with "Associate in Science in Computer Information Technology" and another starting with "Associate in Science in Computer Programming and Analysis"
     * For "Criminal Justice" careers: provide pathways for both "Associate in Science in Criminal Justice Technology" and "Associate in Arts in Criminal Justice Administration"
     * When only one MDC program clearly leads to the career, provide just that one pathway

2. TRANSFER STEPS:
   - Include a transfer step ONLY if:
     * The career requires a bachelor's degree AND MDC doesn't offer a bachelor's program in that field, OR
     * Transfer to a specialized program (e.g., architecture, pharmacy) is required, OR
     * Transfer provides a better pathway than completing a bachelor's at MDC
   - If MDC offers a bachelor's degree that directly leads to the career, DO NOT include a transfer step - use MDC's bachelor's program instead
   - The transfer step should mention articulation agreements and transfer to accredited institutions (e.g., FIU, UF, UCF, etc.)
   - Include information about GPA requirements, portfolio requirements (for design fields), or other admission prerequisites

3. PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE/INTERNSHIPS:
   - Include required professional experience programs (e.g., Architectural Experience Program (AXP) for architects, clinical rotations for healthcare, etc.)
   - Specify required hours when applicable (e.g., "3,740 hours of diverse professional experience")
   - Mention supervision requirements (e.g., "under the supervision of a licensed professional")

4. LICENSURE EXAMS AND CERTIFICATIONS:
   - Include ALL required licensure exams for the career:
     * For Engineers: Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam AND Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam
     * For Architects: Architect Registration Examination (A.R.E.) - mention all required divisions
     * For Nurses: NCLEX-RN or NCLEX-PN
     * For other licensed professions: include the specific required exams
   - Include any required certifications or continuing education requirements
   - Mark exams as "REQUIRED" in the description

5. ADVANCED DEGREES:
   - Include optional M.S., M.A., M.Arch, or Ph.D. degrees when relevant for career advancement
   - Clearly mark these as "(OPTIONAL)" in the level or description
   - Mention specialized fields (e.g., "Master of Science in specialized field" or "Master of Architecture")

6. PATHWAY FLOW:
   - The pathway should logically flow based on the best route:
     * Certificate (MDC) -> A.S./A.A. (MDC) -> Transfer -> B.S./B.A. -> Professional Experience -> Licensure Exams -> Optional Advanced Degrees
     * OR: A.S./A.A. (MDC) -> B.S./B.A. (MDC) -> Professional Experience -> Licensure Exams -> Optional Advanced Degrees
     * OR: Certificate (MDC) -> Direct Employment -> Optional Further Education
   - Each step should build upon the previous one
   - Include clear descriptions (1-2 sentences) explaining what each step entails and why it's necessary
   - When MDC offers a bachelor's program, prefer using it over transfer when it directly leads to the career

EXAMPLES (using ACTUAL MDC programs):
- For Mechanical Engineer: "Associate in Arts in Engineering - Mechanical" (MDC) -> Transfer to 4-year university -> B.S. in Mechanical Engineering -> Professional Engineering Experience -> FE Exam -> PE Exam -> Optional M.S. in Mechanical Engineering
- For Architect: "Associate in Arts in Architecture" or "Associate in Arts in Engineering - Architectural" (MDC) -> Transfer to architecture school -> B.Arch -> Architectural Experience Program (AXP) -> A.R.E. (all divisions) -> Optional M.Arch
- For Nurse: "Associate in Science in Nursing" (MDC) -> B.S.N. (MDC, if available) OR Transfer -> B.S.N. -> Clinical Experience -> NCLEX-RN -> Optional M.S.N.
- For IT Professional: "Associate in Science in Computer Information Technology" or "Associate in Science in Computer Programming and Analysis" (MDC) -> B.S. in Information Systems Technology (MDC, if available) -> Professional Experience -> Optional Certifications
- For Dental Hygienist: "Associate in Science in Dental Hygiene" (MDC) -> Direct Employment -> Licensure Exam -> Optional B.S. for advancement
- For Computer Programmer: "Associate in Science in Computer Programming and Analysis - Mobile Applications Development" or "Associate in Science in Computer Programming and Analysis - Business Application Programming" (MDC) -> Transfer or B.S. -> Professional Experience

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST provide MULTIPLE alternative pathways when different MDC programs can lead to the same career
- For each pathway, select an MDC Associate in Arts (A.A.) or Associate in Science (A.S.) program that ACTUALLY EXISTS at MDC
- Use the exact program names from the list provided in the system instructions
- When multiple valid MDC programs exist for this career, create separate pathways for each:
  * Example: For "IT Professional" - create one pathway with "Associate in Science in Computer Information Technology" and another with "Associate in Science in Computer Programming and Analysis"
  * Example: For "Criminal Justice" - create one pathway with "Associate in Science in Criminal Justice Technology" and another with "Associate in Arts in Criminal Justice Administration"
  * Mark the most direct/recommended pathway as primary (isPrimary: true)
- Each pathway must include:
  * The MDC program as the starting point (A.S., A.A., Certificate, or Bachelor's - only if MDC offers it)
  * Transfer to a 4-year university (ONLY if bachelor's degree is required AND MDC doesn't offer a bachelor's program in that field)
  * Bachelor's degree (if required - prefer MDC's bachelor's program if available)
  * Required professional experience/internships
  * All required licensure exams and certifications
  * Optional advanced degrees (M.S., Ph.D.) when relevant
- If only one MDC program clearly leads to this career, provide just one pathway (but still in the pathways array)

Remember: Only use actual MDC programs that exist. Provide alternative routes when multiple programs are viable options for "${career}".`;
